# Technical Profile

I have a technology degree in System Analysis and Development.

Teams can take advantage of my ability to interact with clients to understand their needs and map them to system requirements. I am also capable of designing, documenting, implementing, and delivering software to production.

For the last 8 years I have been working mostly in the Python ecosystem and therefore I am used to several tools, like:

  - Web Frameworks: Django, Pyramid, and Web2py;
  - Databases and datastores: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis;
  - ORM: SQLAlchemy;
  - Task queue: Celery.

Besides Python, I also feel comfortable working with:

  - Shell script and the Linux command line;
  - Javascript.

I think disciplines and methodologies are core to software development, this is why I use some I consider important, such as:

  - Automated tests (first or after, but mostly TDD);
  - SOLID principles.

Since we must not stop learning, some prospective technologies and methods come to notice for me, like: Go language, going deeper into REST API, Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), Docker, AWS cloud.

I can also communicate in a few languages, in order of competence:

- Portuguese (my native language)
- English (reading, writing, and intermediate conversation)
- Spanish (reading, beginner writing)


# Skills I have but aren't applicable in my current job

- SQLAlchemy
- Flask
- Pyramid
- Web2py
- PHP
- MySQL
- Docker (novice)
- Elasticsearch
