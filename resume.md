## Overview ##

I develop systems for the web, with focus on the backend.

5+ years in Python, Django, shell script and SQL databases. Lately I have been delivering/consuming REST APIs.

I have worked in Telecom, Energy, Fintech, Inventory, Scientific research, and Health, for the government, big corporations and small startups.

I am Brazilian, and Brazilian Portuguese is my mother tongue. Contact me at viniciusban@gmail.com.


## Recent Projects ##

Wrote part of the backend (Python, Pyramid, SQLAlchemy, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, and Celery tasks and beats) of an **automatic phone calling system** for debt collection using PBX integration, in a 3-people team. The system managed to identify "good" and "bad" phone numbers, keeping customers' records up to date. Also, improved the collect ratio making phone calls according to customer's availability and reducing operators' waiting time.

Sole developer of a **wrapper library over three hotel reservation APIs** to search and book rooms, in Python. The library delivered a single interface to cope with those 3 different providers, simplifying the main system code, untangling the developers, and allowing them to focus on improving the system.

Sole developer of a **register of occupational accidents** in Python and Django, to send the occurrences automatically to the Brazilian central government system, through their own API. The system eliminated paper and bureaucracy, improving information accuracy/share across the company. With a very limited time box, I delivered a minimal preliminary version in 2 weeks whilst I was keeping developing the rest of the system.

Main developer in a 2-people team of a **scientific research funding aggregator**, in Python, Web2py, Scrapy and Postgres.  The system optimized researchers' time, delivering filtered information in one single interface and sending them notifications whenever their funding interests were met.
